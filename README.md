# How to Fight in a Ballgown

If you are a protagonist planning to wear a ballgown to an event that might be attacked by **evil minions** ~~or a villain that might be attacked by heores~~, then this is the guide for you.

> Step 0. Find a safe location, like an empty bathroom, with no sycophants in the immediate vicinity so that you can perform the following tasks without interruption.

Your primary goal is to get your skirt out of the way of your legs, so it will not hamper your dueling or ninja abilities. 

## If you are wearing a long, full-skirted dress:

1. Pick up all the layers of your skirt, hiking them up to knee-height.
2. Gather all the excess fabric in front of you into your hands.
3. Pass this fabric through your legs.
4. Once the bunched-up fabric is behind you, separate it into two sections and bring them around either side of your waist, keeping hold of them for the next step.
5. Tie the ends of the two sections together in front of you. *(Yes, the final result will look a little like an oversized diaper, but you now have freedom of movement.)*

## A few additional considerations:

- If you have loose or baggy sleeves that can be grabbed and manipulated, wrap each sleeve around the appropriate upper or lower arm, and tuck in the ends. This will prevent your opponent from dragging you around.
- Your hair (if any) should also be tied up if possible. Consider wearing a hair accessory that can double as a secret weapon if you suspect foul play.
